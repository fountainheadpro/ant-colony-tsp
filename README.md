This is scala implementaiton of travling salesman algorithm based on the paper by Marco Dorigo:
http://www.idsia.ch/~luca/acs-bio97.pdf

It uses separate threads for different ant's traversals to take advantage of multiple cores.

Run it with sbt test to see the progression of finding the shortest path.
